| **ID**  | **Quality Attribute**         | **Scenario**                                                                                                                                                                        | **Associated Use Case**            |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **QA-1** | Security & Privacy           | When the user inputs any data, it is encrypted. This encryption should apply to institutional privacy policies.                                                                      | UC-1                               |
| **QA-2** | Performance                  | When the system has a normal load of users, the system should have a short response time (in under 2 seconds).                                                                      | UC-2, UC-3                         |
| **QA-3** | Performance, Availability    | The system shall support offline cache of recent responses for limited connectivity.                                                                                                | UC-2                               |
| **QA-4** | Maintainability, Modifiability | The system should support maintainers that deploy updates with zero downtime using continuous deployment pipelines.                                                                 | UC-5                               |
| **QA-5** | Performance, Availability    | The system shall support scalability to handle up to 5,000 concurrent users.                                                                                                        | UC-1, UC-2, UC-4, UC-6             |
