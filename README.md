# Project Overview

This project contains all 3 phase submissions for Group 18's final Software Design project. Inside the repository you can find all the steps for the design of a software architecture of an [AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)](/architectural-drivers/Business%20Case.md).

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

Using the requirements provided, we were able to define all of the architectural drivers.

**Architectural Drivers:**

- [Use Cases](/architectural-drivers/Use%20Cases.md)
- [UML Use Case Diagram](/architectural-drivers/UML%20Use%20Case%20Diagram.png)
- [Quality Attributes](/architectural-drivers/Quality%20Attributes.md)
- [System Constraints](/architectural-drivers/Constraints.md)
- [Architectural Concerns](/architectural-drivers/Concerns.md)
